A heavy drinker this one. Best keep watch over the rum
Try spice one too many times and a man'll do anything to get more
Eyes are never bigger than the stomach of this one, and he's eyeing the rations
The noose scar is visible, watch this one's hands
Always ready for a good fight, hopefully you can keep him from one
Medicine is always in short supply with this plaugue-bringer on board
Keep him away from the powder, and have timber on hand
How come we only ever see a red sun with you on board eh?
Hopfully he's as valuable as he thinks he is.
