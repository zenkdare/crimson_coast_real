A gift from the sea herself, or a lifetime upon the waves, no storms will reach their vessal
A hound on any ship is a good way to disuade theives and scoundrals
Fighting aint in their nature, and they got a will strong enough to enforce that
The black cat of any crew, only fate knows what treasures they happen upon
Eyes like a hawk to spot floatsam on the waves
A practitioner aye'. Just hope he can save the leg
Timber is rare upon the sea, and this one can stretch those reserves quite a ways
Always quick with words, and you can be sure of a good deal
Rumors of a shortage? where too my good man!?
